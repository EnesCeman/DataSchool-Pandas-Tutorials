# DataSchool-Pandas-Tutorials
Follow along with the YT Tutorials for Pandas from Kevin Markham @ DataSchool

In the uploaded Notebook is visible different topics presented in YT videos at DataSchool channel.

Every separate video is noted in the markdown with its link to the online video.

From these tutorials I increased the understanding of the following concepts (highlighting only the few):
* concept of axis as a parameter in pandas functions
* using string and dt functions with pandas Series and DataFrames
* working with dates and times in pandas
* map, apply, applymap methods
* using multiindex in pandas
* merging and concatenating tables in pandas etc.
